# Avatar

**Avatar** is a GenAI-powered tool that creates a digital representation of a person by training a finetuned language model (LLM) on their personal data, such as emails, chats, messages, and documents. Additionally, Avatar generates a lifelike voice model using RVC technology based on audio or video recordings.

## Key Features
- **Personalized LLM**: Finetunes an AI model based on available digital communications, preserving a person’s unique style and knowledge.
- **Voice Model Generation**: Uses RVC to replicate the person’s voice for future interactions.
- **Memory Input**: Allows users to input additional memories, advice, or thoughts they want preserved.

## Use Cases

1. **Work Organizations**: 
   - Preserve silent knowledge when employees leave. Organizations can create avatars of their employees by collecting professional communications (emails, chats, code repositories, etc.). This ensures that essential insights and experience are not lost when a key individual departs.

2. **Private Users**:
   - Individuals can preserve their personal memories and personality. For instance, grandparents can create avatars that store personal memories and conversations, allowing future generations to interact with them through AI, even after they are gone. The avatar can retain the person's authentic voice and manner of speaking.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Avatar collects digital data from available sources (e.g., emails, chat logs, documents) to finetune an AI model representing the person's communication patterns and thoughts.
2. **Voice Modeling**: Using RVC, Avatar generates a voice model that simulates the user’s speaking style from video/audio samples.
3. **Custom Memory Input**: Users can input additional memories or specific information they wish to store, making Avatar a more accurate reflection of the person.

## Why Avatar?
- **Knowledge Continuity**: Retain crucial information and experience even after a person leaves an organization or passes away.
- **Personal Legacy**: Maintain an emotional connection with family and loved ones by preserving voice and memories.
